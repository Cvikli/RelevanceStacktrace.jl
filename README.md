# RelevanceStacktrace.jl
Julia relevance Stacktrace. **Not tested on every system!** 

# Goal
What are you searching for 99% of the time during development?
The TOP error of the stacktrace from your project's files. >> It highlights it! :)
The remaining 1% you can use the unhighlighted parts.

# Why
Julia stacktrace is for finding error. Why don't we use it to help us right? ;) 

(Tested for Julia 1.6)
