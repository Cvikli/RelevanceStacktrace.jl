# RelevanceStacktrace.jl
Julia relevance Stacktrace. 

# Goal
What are you searching during development?
99% of the time for the **TOP error of the stacktrace from your project's files**. >> **So it highlights it! :)**
1% you can use the unhighlighted parts. :)

# Why
Julia stacktrace is for finding error. Why don't we use it to help us right? ;) 

(**only tested on Ubuntu for Julia 1.6!** )
